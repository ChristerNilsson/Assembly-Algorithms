Fibonacci converges to the Golden Ratio = 1.618 or 0.618, when n goes to infinity

The angle turned: 0.618 * 360 = 222.48 degrees.

# Please note!

* fib.s calculates the recursive way, but without saving to file.
* sketch.coffee calculates fibonacci using iteration. (n=350)
* fib.py and sketch.coffee are roughly equivalent.
